# 🧑‍💻 SOLUTIONS TO SOFTUNI TASKS

This repository contains solutions to various tasks that are part of the **SoftUni** curriculum. The tasks cover a wide range of topics such as algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented programming, all of which helped me to grow as a developer. 🚀  
I will be uploading the solutions to the tasks throughout the duration of my current course. 📅

## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT?

I am excited about what’s coming next! With the knowledge I've gained so far, I am eager to start working on my **own projects**. The goal is to apply the skills I've learned and create **real-world applications** that will solve problems and make a positive impact. 🌍
